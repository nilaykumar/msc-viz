This project is an attempt to visualize the landscape of research mathematics
using the 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC2020) and zbMATH Open
OAI-PMH API.

todo:
- timing and performance, look for inefficiencies (XPATH through everything may
  not be the best idea, parse more incrementally?)
- replace annals with advances in mathematics (say through 2020)
