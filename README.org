todo:
- look into some graph embedding algorithms:
  - laplacian eigenmaps:
    - incorporate height (relative popularity of a code?), draw contours
    - 3-digit MSC codes (3d representation?)
    - map out data from another journal, how different are the neighbors?
  - ...?
- requirements.txt
- readable documentation
